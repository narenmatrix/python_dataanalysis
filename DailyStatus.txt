From Core Salesforce:
Source: raw.salesforce.lead or raw.salesforce.contact
Fields Requested: Online Campaign, Online Source, Online Medium
Target: TRANSFORMED.ENROLLMENT.snap_applicant_pipeline
Script:models/mart/enrollment/snap_applicant_pipeline.sql(From where should I refer fields from?.. lead or contact?)

From TargetX Salesforce:
Source: transformed.snapshots.target_x_srmb_inquiry_c_snapshot
Fields Requested: Online Campaign, Online Source, Online Medium
Target: TRANSFORMED.BASE_TX.INQUIRIES_TX
Script: models/staging/targetx/base/base_inquiries_tx.sql


Anita, I was going through https://yearup.atlassian.net/browse/SFQ-394 (Regional Director of CE at Account Level).  my understanding is that we need to add Regional_Director_of_CE__c in models/staging/salesforce/base/base_accounts.sql file.
